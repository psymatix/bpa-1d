# One-dimensional Bin-Packing and Subset sum algorithm for Energy Storage scheduling
An implementation of my novel algorithm for generating charging patterns in energy storage systems such as batteries to shave peaks and level loading accross a demand profile.

Implemented in NodeJS and includes frontend visualisation using simple D3 JS bar charts.

Dependencies
------------
1. NodeJS

Usage
-----

1. Start server from command line: node lib/bpa.js
2. Access index.html from web browser to view original demand profile chart, refresh page to generate new solutions
